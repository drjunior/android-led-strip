This is an Android application that uses the IOIO board (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748) to connect to a RGB led
strip (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10312). The application has some cool effects and use the smartphone sensors
to change the "behavior" of the leds.

Fell free to contact me if you need me to change something or if you have a great 
idea and want me to implement it.

Enjoy!
